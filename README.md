# Hytale Cluster (Testing Repo)

## 🤖 Written by an AI
*Note: This README was automatically generated by an AI assistant.*

This is a simple repository for testing a Hytale server cluster setup. It's not a professional project, just a place for experimentation with Docker and Kubernetes.

## What's in here?

This project helps you run a Hytale server inside a container and manage it using Kubernetes. It includes:

- **Automatic Updates**: A script that checks for and downloads the latest Hytale server version.
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Config files to deploy the server, along with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Extra Services**: Setup for ClickHouse, Postgres, and Minio if you need them for your server.
- **Mod Support**: A simple way to include server-side mods.

## How to use it

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and a Kubernetes cluster (like Minikube or Kind) if you want to deploy there.

### 2. Authentication
The Hytale downloader requires authentication. You need to place your `auth.enc` file in the `/app/data` directory (or the volume you mount to it).

### 3. Running with Docker
You can build and run the server locally using Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t hytale-server .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  -p 5520:5520 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  hytale-server
```

### 4. Deploying to Kubernetes
The `kubernetes/` folder contains all the manifests you need.

```bash
# Apply the base configuration
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/base

# (Optional) Apply monitoring tools
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/monitoring

# (Optional) Apply platform services
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/platform
```

## Project Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the server environment.
- `start.sh`: The main script that handles updates and starts the server.
- `config/`: Contains server configuration files like `config.json`.
- `kubernetes/`: All the YAML files for Kubernetes deployment.
- `server-files/mods/`: Place your `.jar` mods here.

This is just a test repo. Use it at your own risk!
